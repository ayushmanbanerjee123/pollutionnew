<h2> Land Pollution </h2>
<a><p>Land pollution occurs when trash, compost, and other toxins are dumped on the land, contaminating or polluting it. Land pollution is caused by human activities such as littering and waste washed ashore from boats, oil rigs, and sewage treatment plants.</p>
<p>Sewage and waste water, persistent organic pollutants (including pesticides), heavy metals, oils, nutrients and sediments - whether brought by rivers or discharged directly into coastal waters - take a severe toll on human health and well-being as well as on coastal ecosystems.</p>
